    <p>Hello!  I’m a UX Designer from Dallas who delves into user research, information architecture and usability testing with enthusiasm and curiosity.  I love human nature and solving users’ problems by immersing myself in their psyches, defining the problem, and ideating with a design team to create a solution that meets the design brief and delights the users.  The phrase that best describes me is lifelong learner.  I study and speak conversational Spanish and am a self-taught chef, baker and interior designer.  I am one of 445 Certified Wine Educators in the entire world.  My favorite wine is Chablis!
