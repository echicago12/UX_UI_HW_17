    <p>Hello!  I’m a UX Researcher/Designer from Dallas who delves into user research, information architecture and usability testing with gusto and curiosity.  I love to observe and study human nature with all its dreams, emotions, desires, drives, and quirks. I enjoy immersing myself in the user's psyche, defining his or her needs, and ideating with a design team to create a product that snaps to the design brief and delights users.  I have been practicing daily meditation for many years.  My logo is my Buddhist name:  Sitting Mountain.  The phrase that best describes me is lifelong learner.  I study and speak conversational Spanish and am a self-taught chef, baker and interior designer.  I am one of 445 Certified Wine Educators in the entire world.  My favorite wine is Chablis!

            <p>I begin my research with this question: “Who are our users and what are they trying to do?”  I identify the root cause of the problem, write an explicit research question and design a research plan.</p>
