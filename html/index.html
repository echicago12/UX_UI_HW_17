    <p>Hello!  Iâ€™m a UX Designer/Researcher from Dallas who delves into user research, information architecture and usability testing with enthusiasm and curiosity.  I love human nature with all its quirks. I enjoy immersing myself in users' psyches, defining their needs, and ideating with a design team to create a product that meets the design brief and delights the users.  The phrase that best describes me is lifelong learner.  I study and speak conversational Spanish and am a self-taught chef, baker and interior designer.  I am one of 445 Certified Wine Educators in the entire world.  My favorite wine is Chablis!
